# BlueView Website Implementation Guide

## üéØ **Google Calendar Integration (Instead of Calendly)**

### What I've Implemented:
‚úÖ **Google Calendar Event Creation**: Demo form now creates pre-filled Google Calendar events
‚úÖ **Smart Booking Flow**: After form submission, users get a link to add demo to their calendar
‚úÖ **Form Data Integration**: All form details are automatically included in calendar event

### Setup Instructions:

#### Option 1: Google Calendar Appointment Schedules (Recommended)
1. Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)
2. Click the "+" next to "Other calendars" ‚Üí "Create new calendar"
3. Set up an "Appointment Schedules" calendar
4. Get your booking page URL (looks like: `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ2FER4j8yzM3_hMVP`)
5. Replace `YOUR_SCHEDULE_ID` in `demo.html` line 525 with your actual schedule ID

#### Option 2: Manual Calendar Events (Current Implementation)
- Users get a "Add to Google Calendar" button with pre-filled demo details
- Works immediately without any setup
- You receive form notifications via Netlify and can schedule manually

### Alternative Tools (If You Want Something Like Calendly):
- **Cal.com** (open source, similar to Calendly)
- **Acuity Scheduling** (Square's booking tool)
- **YouCanBookMe** (simpler alternative)
